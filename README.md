### Hi Friends! :tada:

I'm a high school student in Portland, OR! I picked up coding after finding the need to learn some CSS and HTML for a side project and quickly found a passion for building various projects in code. My current programming skillset includes:
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript (& jQuery) **_Currently Learning_**
* MongoDB **_Planned for October 2020_**
* Python **_Planned for November 2020_**
* MATLAB **_Planned for December 2020_**

My work and projects can be found on [my website](https://marvinlin.me) or in GitHub repositories. Contact me from my website!
