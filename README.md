### Hi Friends! :tada:

I'm a high school student in Portland, OR! I've aquired a passion for the exploration of space and making over the years. I'm also the Mechanical Co-Lead on the OreSat Structure!

My work and projects can be found on [**my website**](https://marvinlin.me) or in GitHub repositories. Contact me from my website!
